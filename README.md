# ML_Task1
NativeSoft Tech ML internship task 1

This project contains a Python script for handling missing data in a dataset using pandas. The script demonstrates how to clean and preprocess data effectively by filling missing values while ensuring compatibility with future versions of pandas.

Features
Handles missing values in numerical columns (e.g., Age) by filling them with the median.
Handles missing values in categorical columns (e.g., Embarked) by filling them with the mode.
Provides an example DataFrame to illustrate the process.
